    dc:abstract """The published scientific literature is an unstructured, specialized, heterogeneous document repository of mixed formatting that summarizes
		 human scientific knowledge. Research into `machine reading' of scientific attempts to convert the knowledge locked into these documents into to a structured
		 format that can be reused and linked into scientific semantic web applications. Research in using machine learning to read scientific papers largely depends 
		 on the existence of annotated corpora that connect appropriate passages of  scientific text directly to a knowledge representation of that text. 
		 Although few such annotated corpora have been developed, the biomedical informatics community have curated literally thousands of different scientific 	
		 databases across multiple subjects. We here describe a `distant supervision'  strategy that uses Figure references in the results sections of papers to 
	     link text to database records. We here develop an example data set based on the European Bioinformatics Institute's INTACT databasee. 
		 We describe open source information extraction methods to link the text pertaining to specific figures with INTACT data records that include the figure 
		 legend as curation metadata. We provide an example data set of  1,974 INTACT data records taken from {\color{red} 1,063 ???} open-access papers. 
		Conforming to semantic web standards, we provide access to this data as Research Objects under a variety of formats (including Web Annotations and BioPax files).""";
